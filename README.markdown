### Description
Aakari is a Ghost theme based on Bootstrap 4. The theme's layout is simple and effective. Inspiration was taken from the blog of Digital Ocean. The theme has a transparent navbar followed by a topics bar. When the navbar is scrolled out of the topics bar, it adds a shadow effect. The theme uses very simple layout, and the actual blog posts are wrapped by a custom container. This is actually me second Bootstrap 4 based Ghost Theme.

### Libraries
1. Bootstrap 4 (Main style sheet, Slightly modified)
2. Google Fonts (Typography font)
3. FontAwesome (For rendering icons)
4. JQuery Lazy (For lazy loading images, so theme loads quickly)
